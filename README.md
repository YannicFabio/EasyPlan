"# EasyPlan - Nextcloud Shiftplaner" 
Nextcloud ShftPlaner with Python3-backend. 
Created with Fokus on basic and simple usable wizzard-like Shiftschedule, User and Group management.

To use this app, it is necessary to have a Nextcloud instance installed and, as described in the last chapter of the Nextcloud app dev tutorial series, to create and customize the API interface for Python.

By default, linters, pre-commit and other useful little things are configured here.
